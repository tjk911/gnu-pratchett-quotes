# GNU Terry Pratchett quotes

This is a simple wordpress plugin hackjob that was put together to replace 'Hello Dolly' with Terry Pratchett quotes instead.
Quotes are pulled from [LSpace](http://www.lspace.org/books/pqf/), stored locally so that we don't swarm their servers, and then spat out onto the page.
Most of the original code was ripped from 'Hello Dolly'
### Things to do
* Name it something else
* Fix the styling issue
* Parse through the quotes better
